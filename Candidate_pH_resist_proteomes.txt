#John Kane and Emily Selland
#for the BioComputing Project, we decided a that a good place for this grad student to start in	terms of further investigation into these proteomes which are resistant to pH,
#would be to choose the proteomes with >0 (presence of) mcrA genes and >8 hsp70 genes, because we saw a clustering of 8 copies of hsp70 and then a large jump in copy number after

#list below:
proteome number, mcrA number, hsp70 number
proteomes//proteome_05.fasta,7,14
proteomes//proteome_24.fasta,7,15
proteomes//proteome_07.fasta,7,17
proteomes//proteome_03.fasta,7,22
proteomes//proteome_42.fasta,7,22
proteomes//proteome_45.fasta,7,22
proteomes//proteome_50.fasta,7,22,
proteomes//proteome_23.fasta,15,14

#we suggest the grad student uses proteome 5, proteome 24, proteome 7, proteome 3, proteome 42, proteome 45, proteome 50, and proteome 23 for further investigation
#cheers
